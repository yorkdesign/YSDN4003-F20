					<h5>Introduction</h5>
					<p class="date">Week 4 - October 6</p>
					</div>
					<p>The main goal of this assignment is to leverage existing material into your own appropriation. It is also a way to add extra value to existing design materials.</p>

					<div class="testimonial">
						<h3>“Since this class is for fourth-year students, it is your responsibility to judge which methodology is relevant and why.”</h3>
						<h6>[Philippe Jean] <span>Fall 2020</span></h6>
					</div>

					<p>The deeper you go in your reflection, the better. In other words, perceive this assignment brief as a floor, rather than a gate, or ceiling. No minimum elements are required, but there are high expectations.</p>

					<p>Make sure to explain the original context of the investigation as an introduction. </p>
					
					<p>Various design techniques must be done within this assignment:</p>
					<div class="answers">
						<ul>
							<li>User flow</li>
							<li>Paper prototype</li>
							<li>Mid fidelity wireframes</li>
							<li>High fidelity interactive prototype</li>
							<li>Visual design style guide</li>
							<li>Micro-animations</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<p>What can I change on the project selected from the class?</p>
					<div class="answers">
						<ul>
							<li>It is up to you!</li>
							<li>Reminder, the essence, purpose, and goal should remain the same.</li>
							<li>However, you can change direction, features, and visual language.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<p>Since I did not start the project, am I allowed to take credit for this redesign and put it in my portfolio?</p>
					<div class="answers">
						<ul>
							<li>Yes, absolutely.</li>
							<li>As a designer, it is pretty rare that you start a project from scratch.</li>
							<li>Typically, it is either an existing visual language in place or a digital platform that is already live.</li>
							<li>Thus, multiple times, our role is to revise and increase the value of an existing ecosystem.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<p>What is the expectation in terms of delivery on a weekly basis until the submission on November 12?</p>
					<div class="answers">
						<ul>
							<li>You are responsible to lead it until the end.</li>
							<li>If you feel that in one week you can iterate both papers and mid-fidelity wireframes, it is your call.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<br>

					<div class="testimonial">
						<h3>"It is important to understand this assignment uses a self-initiated, driven approach.”</h3>
						<h6>[Philippe Jean] <span>Fall 2020</span></h6>
					</div>

					<p>As an instructor, I will advise you according to your pace. However, I am also expecting design techniques that make sense. In other words, I do not want to see UI animations before a clear general interaction design flow.</p>

					<h5>Crazy Height</h5>
					<p class="date">Week 6 - October 20</p>
					</div>
					<p>Inside a small group in the Zoom room, students will do a quick Crazy Eights exercise. The purpose is to let peers share ideas, advice, and low-fidelity examples. All feedback is good feedback and, as a designer, it's your responsibility to decide which idea could be interesting. </p>

					<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
						<div class="answers">
						<ul>
							<li>A random room breakout of three to four students will be done by the instructor</li>
							<li>Each student who presents will be responsible for time scheduling</li>
							<li>No official presentation slide deck is required, 5 minutes maximum, talk and explain your process on Figma with the observing shadow mode</li>
							<li>Eight minutes of sketching ideas and suggesting alternatives from the other students</li>
							<li>Ensure to leverage Figma for this exercise. A dedicated space in student projects should let participants sketch, copy, and paste elements for adjustment, etc.</li>
							<li>Five minutes per participant to explain their ideas</li>
							<li>This in-class exercise should be less than 60 minutes per room, ideally</li>
						</ul>
						</div>
					
					<p>For future information on this technique, please refer to the <a href="methodology.html">toolbox section.</a> Finally, ensure students put their names near their ideas suggested and to reflect it on their website.</p>

					<p><strong>Should I consider and integrate all feedback from my peers?</strong></p>
						<div class="answers">
						<ul>
							<li>Not necessarily,  each student is in charge of his project and design decisions. 
						</ul>
						</div>
					<br>

					<ul class="black">
							<li class="bold">Due Next Week</li>
							<li>Updated website</li>
							<li>Increase feature and experience with an interactive mid-fidelity prototype</li>
							<li>start clarifying visual design elements such as colour, font, and general mood</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Usability Testing</h5>
					<p class="date">Week 8 - November 3</p>
					</div>
					<p>Inside the class group session, students will participate in a preference test session. For each goal students will pick which variant is best for the project.</p>

					<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
					<div class="answers">
						<ul>
							<li>At the beginning of the class, students will prepare their designs with all variants and goals placed inside a specific frame</li>
							<li>Each student will explain to the class their goals and design choice rationale</li>
							<li>Once the presentation is done, every student will pick a choice for each goal</li>
							<li>Students are also invited to add comments</li>
							
						</ul>
					</div>

					<p>Students will collect all feedback and choices to get a better sense for decisions. Once the exercise is done, every designer should have a better sense of what variation is the best and where.</p>

					<ul class="black">
							<li class="bold">Due Next Week</li>
							<li>Revised general design experience and style guide</li>
							<li>Getting used to Figma smart animate through animation exploration</li>

					<h5>Preference Testing</h5>
					<p class="date">Week 9 - November 10</p>
					</div>
					<p>As an individual in class exercise, you will simulate an usability testing by writing the script scenario. </p>

					<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
					<div class="answers">
						<ul>
							<li>Narrow down few key core component you want to test</li>
							<li>Write a quick introduction paragraph for helping participants to get context</li>
							<li>Definite all the steps by steps ask to achieves</li>
							<li>Finishing the test by thanking participants and allows them to add more general feedbacks</li>
							
						</ul>
					</div>

					<p>Make sure to leverage the template inside class Figma space. Minimum of 3 scenarios should be done in class</p>

					<p>The interface can be developed for any device/medium and for any purpose - either exploratory, utilitarian or speculative. All students should think outside the box.</p>
					<p>The application developed will be an expression of the student's exploration of interactive design and the chosen topic; however, it must have a precise goal/use, be engaging, provide users with satisfying user experience, elicit both wonder and surprise, and ultimately, promote recurring usage.</p>

					<h5>Introduction</h5>
					<p class="date">Week 1 - September 15</p>
				</div>
				<div class="article-content">
					<p>First, students need to narrow down a topic of their interest throughout the research phase. This research should entail the collecting and cataloguing of various sources and types of materials such as (but not limited to):</p>
					<div class="answers">
						<ul>
							<li>Screenshots</li>
							<li>Text Explanation</li>
							<li>Etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>An analysis also needs to be done. In a few paragraphs, students must explain and answer:</p>
					<div class="answers">
						<ul>
							<li>What is your concrete topic?</li>
							<li>What is the goal of the project?</li>
							<li>What do you like about this idea?</li>
							<li>What elements or factors could risk the achievement of your project ?</li>
							<li>What's your inspiration for your project?</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>Also, because this assignment is limited to within a 2 weeks' sprint, students must start crafting their experience with various techniques, including:</p>
					<div class="answers">
						<ul>
							<li>User flow</li>
							<li>Paper prototypes</li>
							<li>Mid-fidelity wireframes</li>
							<li>Light High-fidelity prototypes <em>(not mandatory but highly suggested)</em></li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>Since this assignment is a package of various design techniques together, make sure to use your designer judgement and start with methodology which makes sense. In other words, never start with a high-fidelity prototype first.</p>
					<p>For future information on these techniques, please refer to the <a href="methodology.html">toolbox section</a> on the class website.</p>
					<ul class="black">
							<li class="bold">Due Next Week</li>
							<li>Ongoing process summarize on website process with full design materials Figma links.</li>

					<h5>Feedback Token</h5>
					<p class="date">Week 2 - September 22</p>
				</div>
				<div class="article-content">
					<p>Inside the Zoom class, students will explain their process as a virtual round table. Once all presentations, students will put in practice the first collaborative class review. Under the concept of virtual token attribution, students will provide 8 different sets of feedback inside their respective Figma file.</p><p>Remember, feedback is a gift—you should think critically while you share it. Here are some guidelines and procedures:</p>
					<div class="answers">
						<ul>
							<li>Use the master token feedback component from the class Figma library and paste it inside all student spaces where you want to emphasize your feedback.</li>
							<li>Make sure to include your name.</li>
							<li>Be objective with your feedback.</li>
							<li>Feedback is about the design material and not the person itself.</li>
							<li>Make sure to emphasize constructive feedback</li>
							<li>Students must give 8 pieces of constructive feedback (mandatory)</li>
							<li>All feedback should be captured under your class website as proof and linked to the specific Figma project</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>For future information on this technique, please refer to the <a href="methodology.html">toolbox section</a> on the class website.</p>
					<ul class="black">
							<li class="bold">Due Next Week</li>
							<li>Taking into consideration all feedback received from your peers and Figma collaborators, this second phase focuses on finishing your digital experience with the most depth.</li>
							<li>You're wireframes should be articulated into an interactive prototype with real content.</li>
							<li>A basic visual design language should be also submitted.</li>
					</ul>
